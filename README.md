C - Simple Shell

This is a collaborative work between George Israel and Obinna Chukwu. This is a simple shell program written in C that allows the user to execute commands and perform various operations, such as input/output redirection, piping, and command line argument parsing. The program is designed to mimic the behavior of the Unix shell (/bin/sh) and produce the same output and error output.
